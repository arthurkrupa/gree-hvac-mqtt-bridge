# Gree HVAC MQTT bridge

Bridge service for communicating with Gree air conditioners using MQTT broadcasts. It can also be used as a [Hass.io](https://home-assistant.io/) addon.

## Requirements

- NodeJS (>=11.0.0) with NPM
- An MQTT broker and Gree smart HVAC device on the same network
- Docker (for building Hass.io addon)

## Running locally

Make sure you have NodeJS (>=8.11.0) installed and run the following (adjust the arguments to match your setup):

```shell
npm install
node index.js \
    --hvac-host="192.168.1.255" \
    --mqtt-broker-url="mqtt://localhost" \
    --mqtt-topic-prefix="home/greehvac" \
    --mqtt-username="" \
    --mqtt-password=""
```

## Supported commands

MQTT topic scheme:

- `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/COMMAND/get` Get value
- `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/COMMAND/set` Set value

Note: _boolean_ values are set using 0 or 1

| Command | Values | Description |
|-|-|-|
| **temperature** | any integer |In degrees Celsius by default |
| **mode** | _off_, _auto_, _cool_, _heat_, _dry_, _fan_only_|Operation mode |
| **fanspeed** | _auto_, _low_, _mediumLow_, _medium_, _mediumHigh_, _high_ | Fan speed |

| **power** | _0_, _1_ | Turn device on/off |
| **health** | _0_, _1_ | Health ("Cold plasma") mode, only for devices equipped with "anion generator", which absorbs dust and kills bacteria |
| **powersave** | _0_, _1_ | Power Saving mode |
| **lights** | _0_, _1_ | Turn on/off device lights |
| **quiet** | _0_, _1_, _2_, _3_ | Quiet modes |
| **blow** | _0_, _1_ | Keeps the fan running for a while after shutting down (also called "X-Fan", only usable in Dry and Cool mode) |
| **air** | _off_, _inside_, _outside_, _mode3_ | Fresh air valve |
| **sleep** | _0_, _1_ | Sleep mode |
| **turbo** | _0_, _1_ | Turbo mode |

## Hass.io addon

The service can be used as a 3rd party addon for the Hass.io [MQTT climate platform](https://home-assistant.io/components/climate.mqtt/), although not all commands are supported.

1. [Install](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/) the addon
2. Customize addon options (HVAC host, MQTT broker URL, MQTT topic prefix)
3. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: mqtt

    # Change to whatever you want
    name: Gree HVAC

    # Change MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX to what you've set in addon options
    current_temperature_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/temperature/get"
    temperature_command_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/temperature/set"
    temperature_state_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/temperature/get"
    mode_state_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/mode/get"
    mode_command_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/mode/set"
    fan_mode_state_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/fanspeed/get"
    fan_mode_command_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/fanspeed/set"
    swing_mode_state_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/swingvert/get"
    swing_mode_command_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/swingvert/set"
    power_state_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/power/get"
    power_command_topic: "MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/power/set"

    # Keep the following as is
    payload_off: 0
    payload_on: 1
    modes:
      - "off"
      - "auto"
      - "cool"
      - "heat"
      - "dry"
      - "fan_only"
    swing_modes:
      - "default"
      - "full"
      - "fixedTop"
      - "fixedMidTop"
      - "fixedMid"
      - "fixedMidBottom"
      - "fixedBottom"
      - "swingBottom"
      - "swingMidBottom"
      - "swingMid"
      - "swingMidTop"
      - "swingTop"
    fan_modes:
      - "auto"
      - "low"
      - "mediumLow"
      - "medium"
      - "mediumHigh"
      - "high"
```

### How to power on/off

Hass.io doesn't supply separate on/off switch. Use the dedicated mode for that.

### Running addon locally

Create an `./data/options.json` file inside the repo with persistent addon configuration.

```shell
docker build \
    --build-arg BUILD_FROM="homeassistant/amd64-base:latest" \
    -t gree-hvac-mqtt-bridge .

docker run --rm -v "$PWD/data":/data gree-hvac-mqtt-bridge
```

### Run single device as a service

To run it when the PC starts, a systemd service has to be created by following the following commands.

```shell
sudo cp /opt/gree-hvac-mqtt-bridge/gree-bridge.service /etc/systemd/system/gree-bridge.service
sudo chmod +x /etc/systemd/system/gree-bridge.service
sudo systemctl enable gree-bridge
sudo systemctl start gree-bridge
```

### Multiple devices

As of 1.2.0 the Hassio addon supports multiple devices by running paralell NodeJS processes in PM2. Old configurations will work, but will run without PM2.

config example:

```json
{
    "mqtt": {
        "broker_url": "mqtt://localhost",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "pass",
        "retain": false
    },
    "devices": [
      {
        "hvac_host": "192.168.0.255",
        "mqtt_topic_prefix": "/home/hvac01"
      },
      {
        "hvac_host": "192.168.0.254",
        "mqtt_topic_prefix": "/home/hvac02"
      }
    ]
}
```

## Configuring HVAC WiFi

1. Make sure your HVAC is running in AP mode. You can reset the WiFi config by pressing MODE +WIFI (or MODE + TURBO) on the AC remote for 5s.
2. Connect with the AP wifi network (the SSID name should be a 8-character alfanumeric, e.g. "u34k5l166").
3. Run the following in your UNIX terminal:

```shell
echo -n "{\"psw\": \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\",\"ssid\": \"YOUR_WIFI_SSID\",\"t\": \"wlan\"}" | nc -cu 192.168.1.1 7000
````

Note: This command may vary depending on your OS (e.g. Linux, macOS, CygWin). If facing problems, please consult the appropriate netcat manual.
